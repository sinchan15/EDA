Exploratory Data Analysis
====================================================================

For CaseStudy1.R and CaseSatudy2.R, the data is available at
https://github.com/oreillymedia/doing_data_science

CaseStudy.R explores the Clicks/Impression values and explores
different patterns using histograms, plots and other fuctions
in R. There are 31 datasets named nyt1.csv, nyt2.csv,…,nyt31.csv
Each one represents one (simulated) day’s worth of ads shown and
clicks recorded on the New York Times home page in May 2012. Each
row represents a single user. There are five columns: age, gender
(0=female, 1=male), number impressions, number clicks, and loggedin.
We used R to handle these data. It’s a programming language
designed specifically for data analysis, and it’s pretty intuitive 
to startusing.

CaseStudy2.R is another data analysis on Rolling Sales Update.
Our first challenge is to load in and clean up the data. Next, 
conduct exploratory data analysis in order to find out where 
there are outliers or missing values, decide how you will 
treat them, make sure the dates are formatted correctly, make
sure values you think are numerical are being treated as such, 
etc.
Once the data is in good shape, conduct exploratory data 
analysis to visualize and make comparisons (i) across
neighborhoods, and (ii) across time. If you have time, start 
looking for meaningful patterns in this dataset.
Summarize your findings in a brief report aimed at the CEO.

Flights.R summarizes the data available at 
https://github.com/sinchan15/Flight_Details

It plots all the airports in a Map of the United States and
calculates the K-means clusters of the passengers to the 
available number of seats in every flight.

The formal documentation can be found in Project_Report.pdf.
